# JSON Resume PHP Library

## Introduction

Autogenerated Classes for the JSON Resume Schema.

## Updating the JSON Schema
Via composer we are importing the schema `https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema`. To update this the version must be modified within composer.json to match the tag within the repo. Then run `php update`, this will update the classes and then tag this repository with the same version as resume schema.
